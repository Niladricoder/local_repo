# I am learning git.
To commit any file from my local pc there are some spets:
1) add the changes : git add <file_name> when you have to add all the files then use "." as the file name
2) commit the changes: git commit -m "some message"
3) push the file: git push origin main  => upload local repo content into remote repo. Here origin is the remote repo name. Main is the branch name.
# Init command
=>It is used to create new git repo. 
commad: git init =>  this command create a default repo into git repo.
After creating the init file we will create a new repo in github then copy HTTPS link and run the command to set origin: git remote add origin <link of the repo>
